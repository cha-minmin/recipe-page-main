## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the easieast challenge in Fronendmentor but it took me some time to complete it. Choosing to use the table element instead of Flexbox was challenging since I had to search how to style the tables in order to achieve the design from Figma.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: var(--brown-800);
  font-size: small;
}

### Continued development

I want to focus on creating an effective workflow. In this challenge I added classes which ultimately I didn't use. I want to be more proficient in using advanced selectors and also work on web accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/css-marker-pseudo-element) - This helped me to customize the bullets.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp) - Styling the tables
